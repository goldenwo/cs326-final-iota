## Fall 2020 

## Overview:
Stonks is a website that allows the user to track their stock portfolio and see how it is performing. The user is able to create an account and log in. They will be able to see rankings of other user's portfolios compared to theirs. On the sidebars they will also be able to see trending portfolios and track their own portfolio.

One unique way that Stonks is different compared to other investing sites is the groups page that has the different groups of investors that the user is currently in.

## Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

Users are authenticated using the passport api that we learned from class. Each user would first register on the registration page, then javascript code runs to ensure all fields are valid. Afterwards, it sends the information to our endpoint and updates the database with the information. For the login, it compares the information retreived from the database that matches the login username to the hashed password and salt using miniCrpyt.js. The user.html page would not be accessible until the user logged on and is authenticated.
