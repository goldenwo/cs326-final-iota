# Innovative Idea
Our project idea is a website that hosts an investing competition. It is centered around following users (retail / verified traders) in stocks and crypto who post daily trades. There will be rankings on the website that rank users by ROI / trades in a row profitable for the general public to see. This creates a competitive setting where friends and users of the site can compete with each other and publicize their results. You can compete in various public "leagues" or competitions" with various time horizons (i.e. Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) to see who can make the best decisions and have the best research. You can also create groups and have private competitions within friend groups, classes, clubs, etc. For this website there will also be a big emphasis on the millenial investor with help for people just getting into investing for the first time. We might even be able to link actual investing platforms APIs together to have data from these platforms such as Fidelity and Robinhood to verify investor claims as a bonus aspect of the project.

# Important Data
Components to our project include a page that ranks top public investors by gain % with a graph that shows their progress. It would also include a page for all of the groups that would be possible within the website and a place for users to join / interact with these groups. A user account system would also be needed for users to login and record their investments and track how they are performing compared to their peers.
